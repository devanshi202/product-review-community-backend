# product-review-community-backend

Product review community backend [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) app. It includes the use of [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/) and [Spring security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security).

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven ](https://maven.apache.org)
- [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/)


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.springboot.project.ProductAndReviewApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
